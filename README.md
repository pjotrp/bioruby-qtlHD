[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/pjotrp/bioruby-qtlHD.png)](http://travis-ci.org/pjotrp/bioruby-qtlHD)

This is a Ruby module for accessing R/qtlHD.  R/qtlHD (or qtlHD) is the next
generation implementation of R/qtl. qtlHD is aimed at QTL analysis of
high-density, high-throughput data; for example for next generation sequencing
(NGS) RNA-seq expression QTL (eQTL). For more on R/qtlHD, see
